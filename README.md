The lack of health assistance by medical practioners into remote areas was our inspiration behind making the app. We are aiming to give access to every needy person to a doctor who can guide them and help in finding out diseases at earlier stages so that they can be cured faster and in a easier way.

One click away doctor app helps a person to book their appointments with doctors through one click after signing into their account. After payment of fees, the appointment is confirmed. It gives the notification to the person what the doctor has to say. It also shows the medical reports. It has a discussion forum. Patients can also give feedback and view their status.

We built it using html5.We used Adobe XD for designing the app.
